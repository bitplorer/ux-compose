## [0.1.0] — 2026-08-24

### Added

- Community health files: Code of Conduct, Security, Support, Governance, issue and pull-request templates.
- Standard Readme README with canonical (non-stub) doc links.
- Documentation contract: [docs/DOCUMENTATION.md](docs/DOCUMENTATION.md).
- Product `uxcompose build` — CSS minify via `ux_compose.tailwind`. App folders: `ux_compose.assets.WebAssets`. ux-dom keeps className + `<link>` + package static.
- `create-app` teaching surface: `settings.py`, `document.py`, `assets/css/input.css`, `requirements.txt`.
- Tailwind CLI finder / download / ensure moved here (`ux_compose.tailwind`). ux-dom does not compile CSS (`TailwindCommand` fail-closed).
- `WebAssets` lives here (`ux_compose.assets`). ux-dom stub fails closed.

### Changed

- Product path is `create-app → build → serve → deploy`. `uxdom build` does not compile CSS.
